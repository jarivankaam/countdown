# Framework Boilerplate
## by Jari van Kaam

this project is made to simplify and speed up the process of creating a `new project`. It is very loosely based on a framework I use in my internship. It is not meant to be used as a framework, but as a starting point for your `own project`. 

## Features
 - preconfigured watch commands for sass(scss) based css coding and Typescript.
 - php file router
 - ordend file structure.
 - laravel like naming conventions in folder names.
